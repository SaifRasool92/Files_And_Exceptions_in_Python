This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that demonstrate essential concepts related to file handling and exception management in Python. It serves as a practical guide for beginners to understand how to read, write, and store data efficiently while managing runtime errors gracefully.

## Repository Overview

### 1. Reading from a File
Learn how to open and read data from text files using different Python methods such as `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()`. This section also covers best practices like using the `with` statement to handle file operations safely.

### 2. Writing to a File
Explore how to write data to files in Python. This notebook demonstrates how to create new files, append data to existing files, and manage file modes such as `'w'`, `'a'`, and `'r+'`.

### 3. Exceptions
Understand how to handle errors and exceptions in Python. Topics include:
- Using `try-except` blocks
- Handling specific exceptions
- Using `else` and `finally` clauses
- Raising custom exceptions

### 4. Storing Data
Learn techniques for storing and retrieving structured data. This includes:
- Using the `json` module for data serialization
- Saving Python data structures such as lists and dictionaries
- Loading data from JSON files for reuse

## Learning Objectives
By exploring these notebooks, you will:
- Gain hands-on experience with file input/output operations
- Learn to manage errors effectively to prevent program crashes
- Understand how to store and reuse data efficiently
